- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

With this blog, I hope to share my story with the world. I will be documenting my journey as a 20-year-old who is in debt and trying to figure out life.

If that sounds interesting, you'd love the content I share on my Threads account.
